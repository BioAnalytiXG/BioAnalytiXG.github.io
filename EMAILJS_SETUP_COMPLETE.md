3. Configure to send FROM: `noreply@bioanalytix.info` 
4. Configure to send TO: `info@bioanalytix.info`
5. Note the Service ID (should be `service_bioanalytix`)

### 3. Create Email Template

3. Use this template content:

```

Reply to: {{reply_to}}
```

### 4. Template Variables

### 5. Update Public Key (if needed)
