# Beta Form Email Setup Solutions for GitHub Pages

Since GitHub Pages only serves static files and doesn't support PHP, here are several working solutions to make your beta form send emails to info@bioanalytix.info:

## 🏆 RECOMMENDED SOLUTION: Netlify Forms (Free & Easy)

### Step 1: Deploy to Netlify
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
2. Deploy your site on Netlify (keeps GitHub Pages as backup)

### Step 2: Update the form in `beta-tester-form/index.html`:
```html
<form id="betaForm" name="beta-application" method="post" data-netlify="true" data-netlify-recaptcha="true">
    <input type="hidden" name="form-name" value="beta-application">
    <!-- Rest of your form fields stay the same -->
```

### Step 3: Configure Netlify notifications:
- Go to Netlify Dashboard → Site Settings → Forms → Form notifications
- Add email notification to: info@bioanalytix.info

## 🥈 ALTERNATIVE 1: Formspree (Free tier available)

### Step 1: Sign up at https://formspree.io
### Step 2: Create a form and get your endpoint
### Step 3: Update form action:
```html
<form id="betaForm" action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID" method="post">
    <input type="hidden" name="_replyto" value="info@bioanalytix.info">
    <input type="hidden" name="_subject" value="New Beta Tester Application - BioAnalytiX">
    <input type="hidden" name="_next" value="https://bioanalytix.info/beta-tester-form/?success=true">
    <!-- Rest of your form fields -->
```

## 🥉 ALTERNATIVE 2: EmailJS (JavaScript-based)

### Step 1: Sign up at https://www.emailjs.com/
### Step 2: Set up email service (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
### Step 3: Add EmailJS to your form with JavaScript

## 🔧 ALTERNATIVE 3: Use your own server

If you have a web hosting service that supports PHP:
1. Upload the existing `submit-beta-application.php` to your server
2. Update form action to point to your server:
```html
<form id="betaForm" action="https://yourserver.com/submit-beta-application.php" method="post">
```

## 📧 Current PHP Configuration (Already Done)

Your `submit-beta-application.php` is already configured correctly:
- ✅ Sends to: info@bioanalytix.info  
- ✅ Professional HTML email template
- ✅ Form validation and security
- ✅ Application logging

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED:

1. **Choose a solution** (Netlify Forms recommended)
