# BioAnalytiX Beta Application Email Fix

## üîç Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. JavaScript Not Submitting Form Data
**Problem:** The JavaScript was only simulating form submission instead of actually sending data to the PHP backend.

**Solution:** Updated `assets/js/beta-form-enhanced.js` to:
- Actually call `submitFormData()` instead of just showing success message
- Properly handle server responses and errors
- Provide better user feedback

### 2. Email Functionality Issues
**Problem:** Various potential issues with email sending on the server.

**Solution:** Enhanced `submit-beta-application.php` with:
- Better error logging and debugging
- Improved email headers
- Fallback to save emails to log files if mail() fails
- More detailed error reporting

## üõ†Ô∏è Files Modified

1. **`assets/js/beta-form-enhanced.js`**
   - Fixed `handleFormSubmission()` to actually submit data
   - Enhanced `submitFormData()` for better error handling

2. **`submit-beta-application.php`**

$mail->isSMTP();
$mail->Host = 'smtp.gmail.com'; // or your SMTP server
$mail->SMTPAuth = true;
$mail->Username = 'your-email@gmail.com';
$mail->Password = 'your-app-password';
$mail->SMTPSecure = PHPMailer::ENCRYPTION_STARTTLS;
$mail->Port = 587;
```
